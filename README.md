## How to Play

Just like traditional [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle) attempt to guess a random 5 letter word in six tries or less.
Type a valid 5 letter word into the input field, press enter and your word appears in a row.
Green letters represent a perfect position match between your guess and the Wordle.
Yellow letters tell you the letter is in the Wordle, but in another position.
Use these clues to decipher the Wordle.
Click 'Another Game?' to play again.

## About

This is a the first project completed by **Kimberley Rogers** as part of [General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote) course.

The project allowed me to solidify the concepts I have been learning during Unit 1 of the course, including:

#### HTML
+ Semantic HTML
+ Tags, IDs, classes
+ Boilerplate
+ Importing Fonts

#### CSS
+ Flexbox
+ Grid

#### Javscript
+ Functions
+ Loops
+ Arrays
+ if/else if statements
+ DOM manipulation

I'm most proud of the function I built to ensure that words with repeat letters display with the correct colour (green/yellow/none). This process tested my understanding of Javascript, my patience and required approximately 74,840 console.logs

## Future Iterations
#### Things I'd like to add

Make the 'wordle' title dance on hover or on load
Make the error/win/lose message dance on load
Light mode button to reverse black and white of the page
Hard mode - where user must include the green/yellow letters used in the previous turn
